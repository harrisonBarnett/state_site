                <p>South Carolina is a state situated in the coastal Southeastern region of the United States. It shares its northern border with North Carolina, is flanked to the southeast by the Atlantic Ocean, and faces Georgia to the southwest across the Savannah River. Together with North Carolina, it forms the Carolinas region along the East Coast.</p>
                <br />
                <p>South Carolina got its name as a nod to King Charles I of England, the founder of the English colony, where "Carolus" is Latin for "Charles." In 1712, the Province of South Carolina was established, eventually becoming a royal colony in 1719. A key player among the original Thirteen Colonies, South Carolina witnessed significant action during the American Revolutionary War, hosting over 200 battles and skirmishes.</p>
